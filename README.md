# Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to the readme for the site with arguably the coolest Tic Tac Toe game of all time, a game that takes seconds to learn but minutes to master!

## URL

Go ahead, visit [Matt's Tic-Tac-Toe Site](https://mattkwondo.github.io/tic-tac-toe/), login, and play til your
heart's content.

## What's all this then?

Tic-Tac-Toe has truly stood the test of time and made its way onto the internet. Amazing as it is on its own, this version of tic-tac-toe was made
possible through such amazing technologies as HTML, Javascript, CSS, SASS,
Bootstrap, AJAX, and jQuery.

## Planning and Development Process
To plan for this project I first did my wireframes, then I figured out what I thought would conceptually be needed to make each piece of the project work, then I figured out to the best of my ability what I would need to create in code. From there I tried to approach one manageable piece at a time before moving onto the next one. At times I got stuck and, utilizing the principles of time-boxing, made the decision to move onto something new and come back to that piece later. I learned a lot in this project, by making a point to try to read documenation and understand what things did, as opposed to just trying to find the code that works and move on. When asking for help I also asked for help with the concepts, not just the answer, which I hope will benefit me down the road.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to play tic-tac-toe on the web against friends
as well as strangers.
- As a user, I want to be able to track my win/loss/tie record for tic-tac-toe.
- As a user, I want the game to be spiffy to keep me engaged.
- As a user, I want to be able to log into my account and track my games played
over time.

## Unresolved Problems to be tackled at a future data when I have time
- I wanted to incorporate imagery, but I could not get my pictures to work when
deployed.
- I would like to add two player functionality.
- I would like to get things all centered.
- More advanced tracking statistics would be cool.
